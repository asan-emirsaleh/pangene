.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
To construct a pangene graph, we need to prepare one set of proteins and
multiple genomes. If a gene has multiple isoforms, it is recommended to name
each isoform as
.IR geneName : proteinID .
Pangene will automatically select one protein as the primary isoform and use
.I geneName
in the GFA output. Pangene also identifies and filters out redundant proteins.
The quality of input proteins will affect the quality of the output graph.
.PP
To prepare the input for pangene, align the same set of proteins to each genome
individually and generate one alignment file per genome. Pangene then takes
these alignment files and construct a gene graph. At present, pangene only
works with
.BR miniprot 's
PAF output. Other formats might be supported later.
.SH OPTIONS
.SS Input preprocessing
.TP 10
.BI -d \ CHAR
Gene-protein delimeter [:]. This option tells pangene how to identify the gene
name in a protein identifier. If a gene has multiple isoforms, pangene will
later choose one primary isoform per gene. If pangene cannot find the delimiter,
it will use the protein name as the gene name.
.TP
.BI -e \ FLOAT
Filter out an alignment if its identity below
.I FLOAT
[0.5]
.TP
.BI -l \ FLOAT
Filter out an alignment if less than
.I FLOAT
fraction of the protein is aligned [0.5]
.SS Graph construction
.TP 10
.BI -f \ FLOAT
Two alignments are considered to overlap with each other if their intersection
on the genome is at least
.I FLOAT
fraction of the shorter alignment [0.5]
.TP
.BI -p \ FLOAT
A gene is considered a segment in the graph if it is
.I dominant
in at least
.I FLOAT
fraction of the genomes [0.05]. A gene is
.I dominant
if its best alignment is better than other overlapping genes.
.TP
.BI -c \ INT
Drop a gene if its average occurrence among input genomes is above
.I INT
[10]
.TP
.BI -g \ INT
Drop a gene if its in- or out-degree in the initial graph is higher than
.I INT
[10]
.TP
.BI -b \ FLOAT
Demote an arc if it is attached to a branching vertex and is weaker than the best
branching arc by
.I FLOAT
fraction [0.03]
.TP
.BI -B \ FLOAT
Cut an arc if it is attached to a branching vertex and is weaker than the best
branching arc by
.I FLOAT
fraction [0.5]
.TP
.BI -T \ INT
Apply branch cutting for
.I INT
rounds [7]
.TP
.BI -D \ NUM
Two genes are considered local if they are at most
.I NUM
bp apart [2M]. This and option
.B -C
work together with
.BR -b .
Non-local branching edges will be cut.
.TP
.BI -C \ INT
Two genes are considered local if there are no more than
.I INT
unfiltered genes [20]
.TP
.BI -a \ INT
Prune an arc if it is supported by less than
.I INT
number of genomes [1]
.SS Output options
.TP 10
.B -w
Suppress walk lines (W-lines)
.TP
.BI --bed[= STR ]
Output BED12 format where
.I STR
can be
.BR walk ,
.B raw
or
.B flag
[walk].
This option is mostly debugging:
.B raw
for alignments before graph construction;
.B flag
for alignments after graph construction with filter tags;
.B walk
for alignments used on walk lines only.
.TP
.B --version
Output version number
.SH OUTPUT FORMAT
.SS The GFA Format
Pangene outputs graphs in the GFA format consisting of three line types with
optional tags at the end. The follow table describes the dialect the pangene
uses. Note that this is not a description of generic GFA.

.SH LIMITATIONS
.TP 2
*
In general, more testing needed.
.TP
*
Pangene only works with
.BR miniprot 's
PAF output.
.TP
